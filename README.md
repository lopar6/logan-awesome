A website to showcase my skills and projects

Since making this website I have learned more about CSS, HTML, Javascript, and React. 

### Why would you ever build a static website using Django!?
When I set out to to build this website I did not know how to use any front-end tools. I also wanted to sharpen my Django skills. Additionally, if I ever want to add a database or do some backend style work I will be able to add it in easily. Is Django overkill? Youbetcha.
